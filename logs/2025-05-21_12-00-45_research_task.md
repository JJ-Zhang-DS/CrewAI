# Market Analysis for New Haven CT Multi-Family Developments

### Story 1:
- **Title:** Here's where it's toughest for the middle class to find an affordable home
- **Summary:** A new analysis by the National Association of Realtors highlights the growing affordability gap in the U.S. housing market, particularly affecting middle-income families. The study finds that only about 1 in 5 homes listed in March were affordable for households earning $75,000 a year, a significant drop from pre-pandemic levels. The median sale price in the first quarter of 2025 has risen to almost $420,000, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. With rising home prices and mortgage rates, many middle-class households are finding homeownership increasingly out of reach, especially in cities with zoning or permitting restrictions that hinder new construction.
