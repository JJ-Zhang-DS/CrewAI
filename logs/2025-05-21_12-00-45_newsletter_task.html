                <p>A recent study by the National Association of Realtors exposes a widening affordability gap in the U.S. housing market, significantly impacting middle-class families.

The median sale price has surged to nearly $420,000, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>
                <p>This trend underscores the urgent need for policy interventions and innovative solutions to bridge the affordability gap. It highlights the challenges faced by middle-income families in securing a home, emphasizing the importance of addressing the issue to ensure economic diversity and stability within communities.</p>
